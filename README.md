# Sabacc-Game
A fun side project, trying to recreate the old Windows 3.1 version of the game Sabacc.  Uses simplified rules, at the moment.  Also the code is utter crap.  Just started it will hopefully be making something you can play by yourself.


# Introduction

>Grinning, Han glanced back at Leia.  “Lando used to own the Falcon,” he explained.  “And he sometimes forgets that he lost her fair and square.”  
-- From ‘The Empire Strikes Back’

>Sabacc is a card game, played by the high-rollers of the universe.  Found in casinos, cantinas, and anywhere else that slightly shady deals are made on a regular basis, this game has thrived for centuries as the true game of the gambling elite.  It was, in fact, in an honest 9dpending on who you ask) game of Sabacc, that the smuggler known as Han Solo won the Millennium Flacon from his friend Lando Calrissian, changing history forever… after all, without the Millennium Flacon in his possession, Solo surely never would have found himself in the company of Luke Skywalker, and the Rebellion would have in fact, been doomed.

# Sabacc Rules

## Game Overview

Sabacc is a game played with a deck of 76 cards.  In the Star Wars Universe, this game is played with an electronic deck in which the cards change value due to electronic impulses.

### Suits

There are four suits in the game of Sabacc.  These are:

* Staves
* Sabers
*	Flasks
*	Coins

### Numbered Cards

Each suit contains eleven numbered cards (1-11), with corresponding values.

### Ranked Cards
Each suit also contains four ranked cards:

*	Commander (valued at 12) 
*	Mistress (valued at 13)
*	Master (valued at 14)
*	Ace (valued at 15)

### Face Cards
In addition, the Sabacc deck contains sixteen face cards.  

These are listed below, and there are two of each.  These cards are not assigned a suit.  The different rule variants change the values of these cards, which can either be positive or negative.  The Idiot card’s value never changes and is always zero no matter what rule variant is being played.

*	Idiot
*	Rancor
*	Jedi Knight
*	Jedi Master
*	Dark Jedi
*	Lord of the Sith
*	Smuggler
*	Bounty Hunter

## Standard Rules

The standard rules never change no matter what version of the game is being played.  Sabacc is always played with a deck of 76 cards.  The Idiot card always has a value of zero and the numbered cards are worth their face value (one=1, two=2, etc).  The ranked cards are valued as follows:  Commander=12, Mistress=13, Master=14, Ace=15.  The game is dealt out like poker, except that each player has four cards instead of five.  After all hands are dealt, each player may discard cards and receive new ones.  The number of cards you are able to discard depends on the rules you are playing by.  Add up the value of youar cards to find your total.  If your total is under 23, then your hand value is the same as your total.  If your total is over 23, then your hand value is equal to your total, minus 23.  (ex. You have a hand totaling 29; 29-23=6, so your hand is worth six points.)  If your hand totals over 46, then you automatically lose.  To have a perfect hand in Sabacc, all of your cards must have a value of 23.  This is accomplished by having a hand which totals 23 (Pure Sabacc) or 46 (Sabacc).  Pure Sabacc always beats regular Sabacc. You can also win with an Idiot’s Array; an Idiot card, a two, and a three.  An Idiot’s Array automatically wins if no one has a perfect hand.  The different rule variants will list an additional combination of cards that will win if no one has a perfect hand or an Idiot’s Array.  If no player gets 23, has an Idiot’s Array, or has the winning card combination, then the player with the highest hand value wins.  The rest of the rules change according to what variant you are playing.

If your total is over 46, then you subtract 46 from your total, and subtract the difference from your score.  (ex.  Your hand totals 48; 48-46=2, so you subtract 2 from your cumulative score).  If you get an Idiot’s Array or another Array, then your score for that hand is 23.  If you win the hand, you get a 10 point bonus added to your score.
